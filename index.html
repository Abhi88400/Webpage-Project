                The recent Work Trend Index 2022 study by Microsoft is a
                great resource for all leaders out there trying to
                solve the hybrid work puzzle. However, of the five key trends highlighted by the study,
                the one that really stood out for me personally was that “managers feel wedged between
                leadership and employee expectations.” A cynic friend laughed when I mentioned this to her –
                when have managers not felt sandwiched! Alright, so this may not be a new trend but maybe this
                statistic calls for us to sit up and take notice of the magnitude of the problem –
                a whopping 54% of managers responded in the study that they felt leadership was out of
                touch with the employees. What a transition from just a few months ago when Friday coffee chats and
                virtual town-halls became a go-to guide for leaders to connect with the employees

                closely. In fact, the leaders were so cued into the frontline challenges and reached out
                to all employees so often, that the very role of middle-level managers started to get questioned.
            </p>

            <p class="article-paragraph"> So, what has changed between the summer of 2021 and the spring of 2022?
                Indeed, the Great Resignation
                comes to mind. Also, with two years completed in this new normal, leaders are now keen to bring
                the focus back to the bottom line and productivity. Employees, on the other hand, have moved on
                by prioritising their mental health and wellness. In the midst of this, managers could feel
                stuck trying to balance business results with employee expectations. However, seen differently,
                it’s a huge opportunity for managers to cement their roles within organisations, as coaches and
                champions
                of sustainable engagement. The role of mid-level managers is open to massive disruption.</p>

            <p class="article-paragraph"> Like Janus – the mythical Roman god of doors and gateways depicted with two
                opposing faces – the
                middle-level manager of today has to empathise
                with both the leadership and the employee in order to unlock opportunities. For those of us walking this
                critical tight-rope, here are some of the ways that can help us navigate the sticky mid-level sandwich
                better:</p>

                <h1>1. Be the champion coach</h1>
                <p>There’s no more shying away from coaching for managers. I have come across managers who have been great
                    at delivering results and understand their functional expertise perfectly. However, coaching is not
                    about creating clones of oneself, right? It is not about ‘teaching’ someone how to make the perfect
                    sales pitch, for example. It is about helping your team members explore and identify the ‘right’ sales
                    pitch – what works best for them to get results. This calls for deep empathy, simplifying the process of
                    learning, and listening. When managers become coaches, they often share stories
                    of their journey.
                    Storytelling is a
                    great coaching tool,
                    but don’t forget to listen more than you share as a coach.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-article-2">
                <h1>2. Be a key cultural anchor</h1>
                <p>I believe that building a strong, single culture is the most important contribution of the managerial
                    layer. As an organisation grows, the leadership gets removed from the front-line employees. In order
                    that the vision of the founders is not diluted by the time it reaches the last mile, the managerial
                    cadre upholds and lives the cultural tenets. Great managers ensure that sub-cultures do not crop up.
                    Every team meeting, every communication, and every process embeds the unspoken organisational culture –
                    and it is the managers who are the custodians of these elements. This role becomes more pronounced in a
                    remote/ hybrid work environment. If an employee feels a disconnect in the spoken and written word versus
                    what they experience in their day-to-day operations, their reasons to move on just add up. Modern
                    managers play a key role in holding together their teams towards a common vision – pandemics and great
                    resignations withstanding!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-article-3">
                <h1>3. Be the problem solver</h1>
                <p>By leveraging their functional expertise along with the line of sight they have of the business, managers
                    are in a unique position to problem solve complex problems. Leaders rely on their managers for
                    ground-level information to make decisions. Critical thinking can help mid-level managers discern the
                    right information that is needed for leadership decision making, as well as the other way around – how
                    to slice and dice the leadership decisions for their teams so it makes actionable sense to them.
    
                    The one common thread that runs between the above three roles is the ability to hold a mirror to both
                    the leadership and the team members. Managers need to get out of their traditional moulds of receiving
                    strategic business plans and transmitting them to their teams. By adding an additional layer of empathy
                    to the plans, they will create immense value for the business and the employees alike.</p>
